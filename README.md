# RetroDoom-for-ESP32
This will be an imitation of the original Doom game for the Expressif's ESP32 SoC, using a Nokia 5110 monochrome LCD to display graphics.
Geometry and projections are done. 3D Graphics primitives composed by triangles can be displayed onto the screen. Next is gameplay implementation. 

I guess this could be ran on any SoC with enough amount of GPIO ports and has an Arduino API written for it.
